# Project Vision

This repository started with a simple OpenBSD installation guide but it will eventually grow into a more ambitious network laboratory. The main goals are:

- **Unikernel-based modules**: each tool or service will run as a lightweight unikernel for security and efficiency.
- **Stealth features**: ephemeral and in-memory operations will allow certain modules to run with minimal footprint and reduce detection.
- **CLI orchestration**: a command-line tool will coordinate the modules, making it easy to spin up or shut down services as needed.

By combining these elements, the lab will enable advanced networking experiments while remaining portable and discreet.
